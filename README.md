A Tkinter GUI for quickly running basic optimization/cleanup programs.<br><br>
A work in progress program that is combining several powerful opensource/freeware tools into one, conveniently executable, place. Cuts the required "click/wait/load" time in half, at least. ie:

Having an 'offline' library of known portable progs organized into individual folders, on a Jump Drive. <br>
* `Win+E` (My Computer), `double click` external USB.
* `doubleclick` the specific prog folder<br>
* `doubleclick` the executable to load the desired prog.<br>
* `exit` prog, `back` in the folder directory.
* `double click` secondary diagnostic prog folder
* `double click` executable
* then rinse and repeat for each additional task. <br>
[12 clicks + 2 keystrokes + 4 Window/Directory Changes]

(Then running this, rudimentary/repetitive, series of diagnostics/repairs across several hundred/thousands of computers)

Alternatively, (this repo) offers a process slightly more stream lined and would be similar to the following:
* `Win+E` > `Double Click` Jump Drive
* `double click` Main .Py/.EXE script.
* `single click` desired diagnostic prog.
* `exit` (no need to `back` out of the directory)
* `single click` secondary diag prog.<br>
[7 clicks + 2 Keystrokes + 2 Window/Directory Changes + Consolidates HID swapping]
