# Automated_Optimizer

A Tkinter GUI for quickly running basic optimization/cleanup programs.<br><br>
A work in progress program that is combining several powerful opensource/freeware tools into one, conveniently executable, place. Cuts the number of required "clicks" in half, at least. ie:

The alternative of having an 'offline' library of known portable progs organized into individual folders. <br>
* `doubleclick` the specific folder<br>
* then `doubleclick` the executable to load the desired prog.<br>
* `exit` then rinse and repeat for each desired task. <br>

(Then running this, rudementary and repetitive, series of programs across hundreds/thousands of computers for repair or diagnostics)
