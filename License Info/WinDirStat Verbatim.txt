In general that means you are free to do whatever you like with the binary form (mirror it, put it on media accompanying printed magazines and also use it inside your company) free of charge. You also need not notify us in any way, although we appreciate feedback. The same holds for printed magazines interested in putting WinDirStat on a CD or DVD accompanying their publication. However, we'll happily provide the paperwork, if needed.
